# Django Social Team Builder Project 12
Build a site where people can sign up to find projects that 
need help or post their own projects for other people to join. 
Users should be able to create a brief profile for themselves 
after they sign up with an avatar, a bio, and pick their skills 
from a list. Users can post a project, too, giving it a title 
and description. They should also list the positions they need 
filled for that job with a brief description of what the position 
will be responsible for. Users should be able to find a project 
and ask to join it. If you're a project owner, 
you can approve or deny the person asking to join. 
Finally, make sure you have login and logout links, too.
